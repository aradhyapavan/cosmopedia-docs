      "detailed_description": "Blueshift is the opposite of redshift - it occurs when the source of electromagnetic radiation is moving toward the observer, causing the observed wavelengths to be compressed to shorter (bluer) wavelengths. This is an example of the Doppler effect. In astronomy, blueshift is observed in objects moving toward us, such as the Andromeda Galaxy, which is approaching the Milky Way and will collide with it in about 4.5 billion years. Blueshift is also observed in the spectra of approaching stars in binary systems.",

      "detailed_description": "A bolometer is a device that measures the power of incident electromagnetic radiation by detecting the heating effect it has on a material. In astronomy, bolometers are used to measure the total energy output of celestial objects across all wavelengths, particularly in the infrared and submillimeter regions where photon detection is difficult. They work by absorbing radiation and converting it to heat, which changes the electrical resistance of a temperature-sensitive element. Modern bolometers can be extremely sensitive, detecting temperature changes of micro-Kelvin. Arrays of bolometers are used in space telescopes like Planck and Herschel to map the sky in far-infrared wavelengths, studying star formation regions, galaxy evolution, and the cosmic microwave background.",
